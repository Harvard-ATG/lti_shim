LTI Consumer Lite
=====

This is an LTI Consumer. The best LTI consumer you will ever use.

This uses localStorage to keep the value of the launch URL.
The purpose of this shim is to allow you to run an LTI tool without needing
1. an internet connection
2. an installation of canvas/edx/moodle/blackboard

This could also be used for testing purposes -- to mock the LTI consumer.
